    <p>Laugh or Dare: Participants must answer the card and tell it in the funniest way they can. If everyone laughs then they are safe but if they don't they will get dared by the group.</p>

<p>Cosmic Connection: This Will consist of participants who may be romantically interested in one another. Cosmic connections will break the public facade and get down to the deep intimate questions we all yearn for from a significant other. Cards in this deck will be questions used as ice breakers for new relationships and first dates.
</p>
<p>Unpopular Opinion: Pick cards from this deck to share your views on modern-day pop culture controversies. Have a friendly debate on your unpopular opinion.</p>
